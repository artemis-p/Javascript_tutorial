/* Johnand John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs
3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true"). 
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€*/

var massJohn = 105;
var heightMark = 1.89;

var bmiMark = massMark / heightMark^2;
