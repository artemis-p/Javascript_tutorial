- Every JS object hs a prototype property, which makes inheritance possible in JS
- The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want other objects to inheritance
- The Constructor's prototype property is NOT the prototype of the Constructor itself, it's the prototype of ALL instances that are created through it
- When a certain method(or property) is calle, the search starts in the object itself, and if it cannot be found, the search moves on to the object's prototype. This continues until the method is found: prototype chain.

Functions
- A function is an instance of an object
- A function behaves like any other object.
- We can store functions in a variable
- We can pass a function as an argument to another function
- we can return a function from a function

That's why we say that in JS we have first class functions
